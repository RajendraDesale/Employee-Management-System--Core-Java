# Employee-Management-System--Core-Java

* Create Employee creation system in such a way that the system should be able to search an employee from a repository of employees based on the employeeId

Hint : 
1. Keep 5 employee objects in HashMap 
2. If user doesnâ€™t find then system should throw a customized exception EmployeeNotFoundException
